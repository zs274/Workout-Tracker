# Workout Tracker
An app for users to view and track their daily workouts.

## Pseudo Code
1. Install node packages
2. Read through starter files to see what is needed
3. Create models
4. Create routes

Based on this my code would have to:
- Use database models
- Allow the user to add exercises
- Calculate total sums of weights and duration

## Difficulties
The main difficulty was in deploying to heroku. I feel like I still need to practice this more as I'm not 100% confident with it yet. However it did end up being a simple fix so I was able to sucessfully deploy the app.

## Overall thoughts
It was a bit hard at first to read through all of the starter files and understand what was happening and what needed to happen. However I think this was a useful assignment as it helped with learning heroku and mongo atlas.
